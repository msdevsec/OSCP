Domain Controller Synchronization
   
To launch such a replication, a user needs to have the Replicating Directory Changes, Replicating Directory Changes All, and Replicating Directory Changes in Filtered Set rights. By default, members of the Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, and Administrators groups have these rights assigned.
