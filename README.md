OSCP Cheat Sheet

Commands, Payloads and Resources for the OffSec Certified Professional Certification (OSCP).

The use of automated exploitation tools such as sqlmap is strictly prohibited in the exam, as is the case with the automatic exploitation functionality of LinPEAS. I do not actively monitor the current guidelines pertaining to these tools. Therefore, it is essential to emphasize that I cannot be held responsible if anyone utilizes a tool without verifying the latest exam restrictions and subsequently fails the exam. Prior to the exam, please ensure that you are well-informed about the current guidelines.
